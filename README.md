## Goal

The main goal of the project is to design an Adaptive Controller that allows to take into account the uncertainty on
kinematic parameters of a Duckiebot's model and identify the above-mentioned parameters while it roams around the city.

The first goal would be to identify reliably the trim of the bot after a short period of standard lane following starting from
an arbitrary initial value. This would potentially give the opportunity to get rid of the operation of manual odometry calibration
that is nowadays periodically necessary to guarantee good performances from the bot.
